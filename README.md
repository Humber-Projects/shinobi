# Shinobi: HTML Canvas Platformer

Welcome to **Shinobi**, a hand-coded HTML canvas platformer game! This was my final project for my JavaScript class and holds the honor of being the very first full project I've embarked upon using JavaScript. It‚Äôs a blend of my newfound coding skills with a dash of artistic expression; every visual asset in this game was meticulously designed by yours truly using Adobe Illustrator.

While I'm proud of it, do note that the game is a bit on the quirky side with a few bugs. But that‚Äôs part of its charm!

## üöÄ Features

- **Pure JavaScript**: No libraries, no game engines. A testament to the foundational game development concepts I've learned.
- **Custom Assets**: Every pixel you see is birthed from Adobe Illustrator, echoing my personal touch.
- **Responsive Design**: Designed to be adaptable across various screen sizes for an uninterrupted gaming experience.
- **Novice Charm**: As my first full JavaScript project, expect a few rough edges. It's all part of the journey!

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Access the Game**: Simply [click here](https://humber-projects.github.io/shinobi/) to dive straight into the game.
2. **Controls**: Use the arrow keys to move our Shinobi hero. Master the art of jumping, and shuriken throwing.
3. **Objective**: Your mission? To reach the end of each level. That's about as far as I got...

## üìñ Background

It's important to remember where we come from. This project was not just about coding, but about the journey, the late nights, the aha moments, and the occasional desire to throw my computer out of the window. While it‚Äôs far from perfect, it encapsulates my early coding days, and I wouldn't trade that for the world.

## üôè Acknowledgements

- Immense gratitude to my JavaScript class instructor and the amazing peers who were with me on this ride.
- Adobe Illustrator for giving wings to my creativity.
